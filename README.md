Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Description:
This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning algorithms. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing 400 patient records with 25 clinical features. The project implements data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to develop an optimized prediction system.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection using PCA, and feature normalization.
Feature Selection: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Ensemble methods used to select the most relevant features.
Machine Learning Models: Trained multiple models (SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Neural Networks, Na√Øve Bayes) and optimized them using GridSearchCV.
Best Model Selection: SVM achieved 98.75% accuracy with the best trade-off between performance and computational efficiency.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Tkinter, allowing users to input clinical data and get real-time CKD predictions.
